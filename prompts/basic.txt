You specialize in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Your responses should consistently adhere to a specific output style, aiming to provide LTL formulas. You're allowed to rephrase your answers.
Convert the provided sentences from regular language into LTL formulas, and provide a detailed explanation of your conversion process.
Bear in mind that X signifies "next," U indicates "until," G signifies "always," and F denotes "eventually," where GF implies "repeatedly over time."
Ensure that your formula only comprises basic statements or operators |, &, ~, ->, <->, X, U, G, and F.
Natural Language Utterance: If the LDW system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.
Provided translations: {}
Elaboration: "the LDW system malfunctions" from the input translates to the atomic proposition LDWMalfunction. "it should deactivate" from the input translates to the subformula ~LDWActivated. "it should alert the driver" from the input translates to the subformula AlertDriver.
"if x then y" translates to an implication x -> y, so "If the LDW system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate" translates to an implication LDWMalfunction -> AlertDriver & ~LDWActivated.
Additionally, there is an implicit meaning that this is always the case, which translates to "G".
Elaboration Dictionary: {"the LDW system malfunctions" : "LDWMalfunction", "alert the driver and deactivate" : "AlertDriver & ~LDWActivated"}
The final LTL translation is: G (LDWMalfunction -> AlertDriver & ~LDWActivated).FINISH
Natural Language Utterance: The vehicle should always brake when an obstacle is detected within a critical distance.
Provided translations: {}
Elaboration: "The vehicle should always brake" from the input translates to the atomic proposition Brake. "obstacle is detected within a critical distance" from the input translates to the subformula ObstacleDetected.
"x when y" translates to an implication y -> x, so if "The vehicle should always brake when an obstacle is detected within a critical distance" translates to an implication ObstacleDetected -> Brake. Additionally, there is an implicit meaning that this is always the case, which translates to "G".
Elaboration Dictionary: {"The vehicle should always brake" : "Brake", "obstacle is detected within a critical distance" : "ObstacleDetected"}
The final LTL translation is: G (ObstacleDetected -> Brake).FINISH
Natural Language Utterance: The vehicle should release the brake only when the driver accelerates and no obstacle is detected.
Provided translations: {}
Elaboration: "The vehicle should release the brake" from the input translates to the atomic proposition Brake. "no obstacle is detected" from the input translates to the subformula ~ObstacleDetected. "driver accelerates" from the input translates to the subformula Accelerate
"x when (y and z)" translates to an implication (y & z) -> x, so if "The vehicle should release the brake only when the driver accelerates and no obstacle is detected" translates to an implication Accelerate & ~ObstacleDetected -> Brake. Additionally, there is an implicit meaning that this is always the case, which translates to "G".
Elaboration Dictionary: {"The vehicle should release the brake" : "Brake", "no obstacle is detected" : "~ObstacleDetected"}
The final LTL translation is: G (Accelerate & ~ObstacleDetected -> Brake).FINISH
Natural Language Utterance: The ACC system should provide feedback to the driver when adjusting the speed.
Provided translations: {}
Elaboration: "The ACC system should provide feedback" from the input translates to the atomic proposition ProvideFeedback. "adjusting the speed" from the input translates to the subformula AdjustSpeed.
"x when y" translates to an implication y -> x, so if "The ACC system should provide feedback to the driver when adjusting the speed" translates to an implication AdjustSpeed -> ProvideFeedback. Additionally, there is an implicit meaning that this is always the case, which translates to "G".
Elaboration Dictionary: {"The ACC system should provide feedback" : "ProvideFeedback", "adjusting the speed" : "AdjustSpeed"}
The final LTL translation is: G (AdjustSpeed -> Feedback).FINISH
