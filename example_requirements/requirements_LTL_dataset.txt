The LKA system should activate when the vehicle speed is above a certain threshold and the system is turned on.;G (speedabovethreshold & lkaswitchedon -> lkaactivated)
If the vehicle starts to drift out of its lane without a turn signal activated, the LKA system should make corrective steering adjustments.;G (driftingoutoflane & ~ turnsignalactivated -> correctivesteering)
The LKA system should not activate corrective steering if the turn signal is on.;G (turnsignalactivated -> ~ correctivesteering)
If the system cannot detect clear lane markings, it should alert the driver that LKA is not available.;G (~ lanemarkingsdetected -> alertlkaunavailable)
The driver should be able to override the LKA system by steering manually.;G (manualsteering -> ~ correctivesteering)
The LKA system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (speedbelowthreshold -> ~ lkaactivated)
The LKA system should provide feedback (e.g., vibration or sound) to the driver when making corrective steering adjustments.;G (correctivesteering -> providefeedback)
If the LKA system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (lkamalfunction -> alertdriver & ~ lkaactivated)
The LKA system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor (e.g., heavy rain, snow).;G (poorroadconditions -> ~ lkaactivated)
The ACC system should activate when the driver sets a desired speed and the system is turned on.;G (setdesiredspeed & accswitchedon -> accactivated)
If a slower-moving vehicle is detected in the same lane, the ACC should adjust the speed to maintain a safe following distance.;G (slowervehicledetected -> adjustspeed)
If the vehicle ahead increases its speed or changes lanes, the ACC should accelerate to the previously set speed.;G (vehicleaheadaccelerates | vehicleaheadchangeslane -> returntosetspeed)
The driver should be able to override the ACC by manually accelerating or braking.;G (manualacceleration | manualbraking -> ~ adjustspeed)
If a stationary object is detected in the vehicle's path, the ACC should alert the driver and prepare for emergency braking.;G (stationaryobjectdetected -> alertdriver & prepareemergencybraking)
The ACC system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (speedbelowthreshold -> ~ accactivated)
The ACC system should provide feedback to the driver when adjusting the speed (e.g., visual or auditory signals).;G (adjustspeed -> providefeedback)
If the ACC system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (accmalfunction -> alertdriver & ~ accactivated)
The ACC system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor (e.g., heavy rain, snow).;G (poorroadconditions -> ~ accactivated)
The LDW system should activate when the vehicle speed is above a certain threshold and the system is turned on.;G (speedabovethreshold & ldwswitchedon -> ldwactivated)
If the vehicle starts to drift out of its lane without a turn signal activated, the LDW system should alert the driver.;G (driftingoutoflane & ~ turnsignalactivated -> alertdriver)
The LDW system should not alert the driver if the turn signal is on.;G (turnsignalactivated -> ~ alertdriver)
If the system cannot detect clear lane markings, it should not activate the LDW.;G (~ lanemarkingsdetected -> ~ ldwactivated)
The driver should be able to temporarily override the LDW system by steering manually.;G (manualsteering -> ~ alertdriver)
If the LDW system detects that the driver's hands are off the steering wheel, it should provide an additional alert.;G (handsoffsteering -> alertdriverhandsoff)
The LDW system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (speedbelowthreshold -> ~ ldwactivated)
The LDW system should provide visual and/or auditory alerts to the driver when activated.;G (ldwactivated -> providevisualorauditoryalert)
If the LDW system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (ldwmalfunction -> alertdriver & ~ ldwactivated)
The LDW system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor (e.g., heavy rain, snow).;G (poorroadconditions -> ~ ldwactivated)
The BSD system should activate when the vehicle is started and remain active while the vehicle is in motion.;G (vehiclestarted -> bsdactivated)
The Parking Assistance system should deactivate once the vehicle is parked or when shifted to drive gear.;G (vehicleinblindspot -> visualalertinsidemirror)
