If the brake system detects a malfunction, it should alert the driver.;G (BrakeMalfunction -> AlertDriver)
The vehicle should maintain the set speed when cruise control is activated.;G (CruiseControlActivated -> MaintainSetSpeed)
If the driver presses the brake pedal, cruise control should be deactivated.;G (BrakePedalPressed -> ~ CruiseControlActivated)

The driver should be able to decrease the set speed using the cruise control interface.;G (DecreaseSpeedCommand -> X (SetSpeed = PreviousSetSpeed - IncrementValue))
If an obstacle is detected within a critical distance, cruise control should be deactivated.;G (ObstacleDetected -> ~ CruiseControlActivated)
The vehicle should not activate cruise control if the speed is below a minimum threshold.;G (SpeedBelowThreshold -> ~ CruiseControlActivated)
If the speed of the vehicle drops significantly below the set speed, cruise control should try to accelerate to reach the set speed.;G (SpeedSignificantlyBelowSetSpeed & CruiseControlActivated -> Accelerate)
Cruise control should not be activated when the traction control system of the vehicle detects slippery conditions.;G (TractionControlAlert -> ~ CruiseControlActivated)
The LKA system should activate when the vehicle speed is above a certain threshold and the system is turned on.;G (SpeedAboveThreshold & LKASwitchedOn -> LKAActivated)
If the vehicle starts to drift out of its lane without a turn signal activated, the LKA system should make corrective steering adjustments.;G (DriftingOutOfLane & ~ TurnSignalActivated -> CorrectiveSteering)
The LKA system should not activate corrective steering if the turn signal is on.;G (TurnSignalActivated -> ~ CorrectiveSteering)
If the system cannot detect clear lane markings, it should alert the driver that LKA is not available.;G (~ LaneMarkingsDetected -> AlertLKAUnavailable)
The driver should be able to override the LKA system by steering manually.;G (ManualSteering -> ~ CorrectiveSteering)
The LKA system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (SpeedBelowThreshold -> ~ LKAActivated)
The LKA system should provide feedback to the driver when making corrective steering adjustments.;G (CorrectiveSteering -> ProvideFeedback)
If the LKA system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (LKAMalfunction -> AlertDriver & ~ LKAActivated)
The LKA system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor.;G (PoorRoadConditions -> ~ LKAActivated)
The ACC system should activate when the driver sets a desired speed and the system is turned on.;G (SetDesiredSpeed & ACCSwitchedOn -> ACCActivated)
If a slower moving vehicle is detected in the same lane, the ACC should adjust the speed to maintain a safe following distance.;G (SlowerVehicleDetected -> AdjustSpeed)
If the vehicle ahead increases its speed or changes lanes, the ACC should accelerate to the previously set speed.;G (VehicleAheadAccelerates | VehicleAheadChangesLane -> ReturnToSetSpeed)
The driver should be able to override the ACC by manually accelerating or braking.;G (ManualAcceleration | ManualBraking -> ~ AdjustSpeed)
If a stationary object is detected in the path of the vehicle, the ACC should alert the driver and prepare for emergency braking.;G (StationaryObjectDetected -> AlertDriver & PrepareEmergencyBraking)
The ACC system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (SpeedBelowThreshold -> ~ ACCActivated)
The ACC system should provide feedback to the driver when adjusting the speed.;G (AdjustSpeed -> ProvideFeedback)
If the ACC system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (ACCMalfunction -> AlertDriver & ~ ACCActivated)
The ACC system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor.;G (PoorRoadConditions -> ~ ACCActivated)
The LDW system should activate when the vehicle speed is above a certain threshold and the system is turned on.;G (SpeedAboveThreshold & LDWSwitchedOn -> LDWActivated)
If the vehicle starts to drift out of its lane without a turn signal activated, the LDW system should alert the driver.;G (DriftingOutOfLane & ~ TurnSignalActivated -> AlertDriver)
The LDW system should not alert the driver if the turn signal is on.;G (TurnSignalActivated -> ~ AlertDriver)
If the system cannot detect clear lane markings, it should not activate the LDW.;G (~ LaneMarkingsDetected -> ~ LDWActivated)
The driver should be able to temporarily override the LDW system by steering manually.;G (ManualSteering -> ~ AlertDriver)
If the LDW system detects that the hands of the driver are off the steering wheel, it should provide an additional alert.;G (HandsOffSteering -> AlertDriverHandsOff)
The LDW system should deactivate when the vehicle speed drops below a certain threshold.;G (SpeedBelowThreshold -> ~ LDWActivated)
The LDW system should provide visual or auditory alerts to the driver when activated.;G (LDWActivated -> ProvideVisualOrAuditoryAlert)
If the LDW system malfunctions, it should alert the driver and deactivate.;G (LDWMalfunction -> AlertDriver & ~ LDWActivated)
The LDW system should not activate if the road conditions are detected to be poor.;G (PoorRoadConditions -> ~ LDWActivated)
The BSD system should activate when the vehicle is started and remain active while the vehicle is in motion.;G (VehicleStarted -> BSDActivated)
The Parking Assistance system should deactivate once the vehicle is parked or when shifted to drive gear.;G (VehicleParked | VehicleInDrive -> ~ ParkingAssistanceActivated)
If the driver activates the turn signal indicating a lane change in the direction of the detected vehicle in the blind spot, the system should provide an additional auditory alert.;G (VehicleInBlindSpot & TurnSignalActivated -> AuditoryAlert)
